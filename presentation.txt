Assignement
========================================================

The assignement is to develop a app which is working on a host. 
In this case there is chosen for shinyapps as host.
The criteria which it should be met are the following:

- Was there enough documentation on the shiny site for a user to get started using the application?
-  the application run as described in the documentation?
- Was there some form of widget input (slider, textbox, radio buttons, checkbox, ...) in either ui.R or a custom web page?
- Did server.R perform some calculations on the input in server.R?
- Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?
- Was the app substantively different than the very simple applications built in the class? N
- Here's your opportunity to give the app +1 for being well done, or neat, or even just a solid effort.


The app
========================================================
With the random number generator it is easy to get the number of random numers that you would like.
In this app it is possible to pick from 0 to 1337 random numbers.
That is the first step in the app.
The second step is to pick an minimum and maximal value for the x axis. 
So you can select between a range from -1337 to 1337 to sample from.
Simarly this works for the y-axis.
With these two axis you can selct the area to sample your random numbers. 

Librarys and methods used
========================================================

Ofcourse we used the library shiny to conduct this app.
Secondary there where markdown and knitr.

I was facing some difficulties to insert a second button in the mainpanel (next to "random numbers").
Initially I had planned to put the aboutfile( with information about the used methods). This aboutfile is in RMD but unfortantly I couldn"t find a method to blend it in well. Locally is worked perfect :-)


```{r}

library(markdown)
library(shiny)
library(knitr)
```


Where to find all important info
========================================================

- The about file
Can be found on https://github.com/Samazzo/Peer-graded-Assignment-Course-Project-Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch 
(Although i did rather had it also under a button in the app :'())

- The readme file
https://github.com/Samazzo/Peer-graded-Assignment-Course-Project-Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch

- The shiny app, consisting in two parts:
* ui (userinterface)
* server (server)
